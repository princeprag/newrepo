I am from a family that comes under the Below Poverty Line in the State of Bihar.  My father is unemployed since the last 1 year and we are dependent on the monthly ration provided by the government to feed oueselves. In such a situation it becomes an additional burden for my family to bear my college expenses every semester. I have a family of four members  and amidst this global Covid pandemic
,things have worsened for us. I am a village resident,where there is lack of proper electricity and proper Internet Connectivity.
I am struggling very hard to attend my online classes and exams. I am under severe pressure due to such unprecedented situation. Hence, I am in dire need of this scholarship as it can reduce some burden on my family.

My ultimate goal in life is to become a public servant,an IAS officer. I am from the state of Bihar, where there is extreme poverty and illiteracy. I believe that only using the weapon of education, all the problems of this state can be tackled. Growing up in Bihar,seeing the people suffer day to day due to the ill-governance and economic crisis here gives me lot of pain. I really want to work in the education sector and will consider myself successfull the day when my work will add some value to the lives of people here.
